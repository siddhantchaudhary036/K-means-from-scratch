# K-means-from-scratch
K-means clustering with Euclidian distance created from scratch with no external libraries used.

This clustering algo allows you to input any data. by default its just random values to create a scatter plot. Values diffX and diffY are requested this creates a clear seperation in the data so the user may see visible clusters. 

The best part is at each iteration the current centroid is shown in a plot so the user can see how the clusters slowly evolve into what is expected at each iteration.
